Level 3 (B2/C1) Portuguese football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo attended a White House state dinner where US President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, marking the end of the Prince's long diplomatic isolation following the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump dismissed questions about Saudi Arabia's human rights record during the visit. Ronaldo, who plays for Al-Nassr, a club majority-owned by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund chaired by the Prince, was seated with global business executives like Elon Musk and Tim Cook. Trump introduced the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to his son, Barron, and the football star actively promoted Saudi Arabia's successful bid to host the 2034 World Cup. The dinner coincided with the Prince's renewed engagement with the US as Saudi Arabia pursues its Vision 2030 reform programme to diversify its economy and strengthen strategic partnerships, highlighted by Trump's announcement of hundreds of billions in new Saudi investment commitments and the designation of Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally. Ronaldo, who secured Portugal's spot in the 2026 World Cup, faces a likely ban for the opening match after receiving a red card. Students at the University of Staffordshire feel deceived because a course intended to launch their digital careers is heavily reliant on AI for teaching content. During a recorded meeting, a student named James directly confronted a lecturer, pointing out that the coding module's PowerPoint slides were entirely AI-generated and that the content had not been properly reviewed, noting the presence of American English spelling in the notes despite the slides being edited for British English. The student expressed his frustration, stating he did not want to be taught by ChatGPT and felt insulted by the presumption that students would not notice the AI-generated material. This issue has led students to feel robbed of the quality education they expected from academic professionals. In response to the growing use of this technology, the university had previously uploaded a policy statement to the course website. This document attempts to legitimize the use of AI, outlining a formal framework for academic staff who wish to leverage AI automation in both scholarly work and teaching practices. Russian President Vladimir Putin has changed Russia's nuclear doctrine in response to a broader range of conventional attacks. Previously, Russia reserved nuclear weapons for situations threatening its existence. Now, it could respond to a 'critical threat' to its sovereignty or territory with nuclear force. This move coincides with reports that Ukraine used US-made missiles to strike deep into Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Putin's focus on nuclear strategy over peace efforts, while analysts warn the new doctrine raises the risk of nuclear conflict. However, the US National Security Council stated it sees no need to adjust its nuclear policy. As Moscow's forces are advancing, some experts believe the war could be nearing its final, most dangerous stage. Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, condemned Russia's rhetoric and promised continued support for Ukraine. Poland is a rapidly growing market, now ranked as the 20th largest economy globally, with a projected GDP of 900 billion euros in 2025. Strong domestic demand, low unemployment, and a transparent tax system make it an appealing destination for entrepreneurs, particularly those fleeing the war in Ukraine. This economic success is viewed as a remarkable generational transition from an ex-communist to a capitalist society. Ukrainian involvement is increasingly significant, contributing around 2.7% of Poland's GDP through business activities, jobs, and investments. For Ukrainian founders, setting up a company in Poland is often a straightforward, electronic process, making the governmental aspects relatively easy. However, raising capital remains one of the hardest challenges. Ukrainian entrepreneurs, who were present in Poland even before the war, continue to expand across various sectors, from tech to hospitality. Their businesses, built on a close cultural and linguistic affinity, are helping Poland grow while providing a sense of home for the large number of Ukrainians who have relocated there. The civil war that has been raging in Sudan for over two years has impacted the education of millions of students. With over half of all schools located in conflict zones and many others serving as shelters, a significant educational gap has emerged, leaving many students unable to take exams, especially in states such as Khartoum. The conflict has caused over 150,000 deaths and displaced 12 million people, leading the UN to declare it the world's biggest humanitarian crisis. Online learning presents a challenging alternative due to unreliable internet access, the high cost of data, and the difficult, distracting home environments, which often leave students feeling isolated and disconnected. Furthermore, students are facing a severe psychological toll from the trauma, economic stress, and loss of friends, with limited mental health support available from teachers who are already struggling. Despite these obstacles, there are attempts to resume education: some schools are reopening in safer areas, and universities are encouraging students to return to studies. Displaced students, such as those in refugee camps, get support through projects like the UN's Connectivity for Refugees, which provides internet access and training, allowing them to continue their studies and learn new skills. Eighty years ago, the Nuremberg Trials commenced shortly after World War II, putting surviving Nazi leaders like Hermann Göring on trial for horrific crimes. Over ten months, the court heard from 120 witnesses, revealing the enormous scale of the Third Reich's atrocities. In the end, 12 defendants were sentenced to death, seven were imprisoned, and three were acquitted. Nuremberg was a visionary step that changed international law by holding individuals, not just abstract states, accountable for acts of state. It eventually led to the formation of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague and offshoot tribunals, such as those that prosecuted war criminals like Radovan Karadžić from the former Yugoslavia. Today, the ICC continues this legacy, having recently issued arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas and Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, regarding actions in and around Gaza. However, critics note that political pressure and sanctions, particularly from the US, have caused some ICC investigations to slow down. Nuremberg's message is that those who order or commit genocide must face justice. In Munich, Germany, the Deutsches Museum has put a Cipher Machine 41 or SG-41 on display. It was the successor of the Enigma Machine, and Nazi Germany's military used it in 1941 to encrypt strategic messages during World War II. Fritz Menzer designed the machine to replace the Enigma machine after Alan Turing and his team cracked Enigma. Thanks to an improved irregular encryption algorithm, SG-41 had significantly more encryption combinations compared to the Enigma. Menzer developed other machines, too, and he also worked on cryptanalysis machines to crack the codes of other countries. In 2017, an amateur treasure hunter discovered SG-41 in the forest near Ayin. It was badly corroded because the Nazis stored it underground to probably hide. The Deutsches Museum is using 3D visualizations to make the exhibit more accessible and engaging for visitors. Modern technologies make it possible to explore the encryption technologies hidden inside without opening the machine, which would because irreparable damage. In northern Japan, bear attacks have increased sharply, leading police to begin culling operations. To better understand solutions, Japanese experts visited Montana in the United States, a region known for effective wildlife management. During a large international workshop there, specialists from over 20 countries discussed rising conflicts between humans and bears and exchanged strategies for prevention. One major difference is that Japan relies mainly on aging civilian hunters, while the US employs trained bear specialists who handle everything from damage control to emergency response. These workers receive full salaries, share their contact information publicly, and react quickly to reports from citizens. Another key lesson from Montana is early prevention. Experts use electric fences, secure garbage, and constant community education to stop bears from returning to residential areas. This method not only protects people but also reduces the need for killing bears. Japanese participants noted that their country lacks specialists and that many students trained in the field cannot find related jobs. Strengthening expertise and creating stable career paths may help Japan address its growing bear crisis. In Dubai, UAE, parents are building their children's social circle on a mobile phone app called Play: Date. The app allows parents to set up online profiles for their children and connect with like-minded friends for a play date. To create an account, parents can select details such as preferred language, interests, and schedules. The app is designed for children up to 12 years old, and to generate revenue, it offers subscribers free vouchers for goods and services from its partner brands. In 2017, Play: Date was launched, and currently, it has more than 3,500 subscribers. The app connects families in the UAE, the US, and the UK. The Museum of the City of New York is hosting "Gingerbread NYC," an annual event where professional and amateur bakers create detailed gingerbread versions of famous city landmarks. This year, nearly two dozen participants from all five boroughs built edible replicas of iconic structures, transit sites, and cultural symbols. Their creations include the Statue of Liberty, Governor's Island Ferry, the Roosevelt Island tram, and the Christopher Street subway station. Some bakers chose more unusual subjects, such as the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, admired for its bold design and technical difficulty. Others drew inspiration from literature or theater, including a "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" scene and a gingerbread Broadway stage featuring characters from well-known musicals. For the first time, a classic New York food, the bagel with cream cheese, was also transformed into a gingerbread icon. The exhibition runs until January 19, 2026, and visitors can vote for their favorite piece. Scientists reported spectacular aurora borealis sightings across several US states and explained how these colorful displays are connected to powerful solar storms. These storms begin with huge eruptions of hot material and magnetic fields from the sun's atmosphere. When they travel through space and reach Earth, they disturb our magnetic field and add large amounts of energy to it. This disturbance produces the northern and southern lights but also creates problems for modern technology. Solar storms accelerate charged particles toward Earth's atmosphere, leading to strong electric currents in power networks. These events can also interfere with satellites. Controllers often work through the night to keep low-orbit satellites at the correct altitude, sometimes burning extra fuel to stop them from falling toward Earth. Other systems, such as rockets and GPS, also face difficulties. Precision GPS can become inaccurate by several centimeters during strong storms. Because of this, experts constantly communicate with infrastructure operators to reduce risks and protect vital technology. A new plan has been announced to build the UK's first small modular reactors on the island of Anglesey. The project will take place at the former Wylfa nuclear station, which closed about ten years ago, and will bring major investment and up to 3,000 jobs. The first three reactors are expected to start operating by the mid-2030s and could supply enough energy for roughly three million homes. Local leaders believe this project will strengthen the island's economy, which has suffered because of the closure of large industrial sites. They hope it will encourage young people to stay, work, and raise families on the island. Although many welcome the development, some residents remain sceptical. Opponents of nuclear power have raised concerns for decades and question whether the project truly represents progress for Anglesey. The government hopes that these SMRs will be quicker and cheaper to construct than traditional nuclear plants, helping the country increase clean energy production. Levi's plans to sell its 300-dollar Blue Tab jeans in more stores next year to meet the rising demand for premium denim. The line, launched earlier in Asia and in select stores in Europe and the US, features heavier Japanese selvedge denim, which is more durable and has self-finished edges. Compared to Levi's traditional Red Tab jeans, which top out at 130 euros, Blue Tab cost up to 350 euros and jackets around 700 euros. While premium denim represents only about 10% of the 100-billion-dollar global denim market, it grows faster than standard jeans. Levi's aims to attract more women and diversify its product range, including collaborations with brands like Nike and Barbour. Despite past challenges like inflation and US tariffs, the company expects a strong holiday season and plans to offer limited discounts. Levi's may also acquire additional brands to accelerate growth, adding to its existing Beyond Yoga brand. Uzbekistan opens a new educational center inside the Center of Islamic Civilization in Tashkent. The center allows children to explore the country's rich heritage using technology, storytelling, and interactive experiences. Digital exhibits and animations show the lives of famous Central Asian scholars and scientists. Children can learn how science, art, and creativity shaped the Islamic world. The center also has the International School of Calligraphy, where artists teach both traditional and modern styles of writing. The library contains more than 35,000 books and 2,500 manuscripts. Through fun activities, interactive displays, and storytelling, children gain knowledge of Uzbekistan's history while developing skills in creativity, learning, and cultural respect. They can use the space to understand history, build curiosity, and connect past knowledge with their own lives. By blending heritage with innovation, the center inspires young people to feel proud of their culture and values. This project shows how learning can be exciting, engaging, and meaningful for the next generation. More than 130 gold and bronze artifacts have been returned to Ghana from the UK and South Africa. Many of them were taken from the Asante Kingdom during colonial times, while others were bought later on the open market. Some of the returned items were looted by British soldiers during the 1900 siege of Kumasi. The objects, including royal regalia, drums, and ceremonial gold weights, are between 45 and 160 years old and show the importance of gold in Asante culture. At a ceremony in Kumasi, King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II thanked the South African company AngloGold Ashanti and British art expert Hermione Waterfield for returning the pieces. Waterfield, a pioneering art historian, had long supported the restitution of African art. The event highlights Africa's growing efforts to recover its cultural heritage and reconcile with colonial history. Earthquakes, flooding, and hurricanes because enormous damage to infrastructure and trap people inside collapsed buildings. A Belgium non-profit company APOPO is training rats to search the disaster zones for survivors. The rats wear high-tech backpacks that provide real-time wireless audio-visual communication with the company. The technology includes a video camera and audio which helps trainers work with the rat to find people. It also helps emergency workers communicate with the survivors. African giant pouch rats are curious and like to explore. They are very biddable, and they can be trained much like a dog. In addition to their adventurous spirit, their small size and excellent smell sense makes them perfect for locating things in tight space. The rats are being trained in a simulated disaster zone. They must locate the target person in an empty room, pull a switch on their vest to trigger a beeper, and then return to base for a reward. Trainers are gradually increasing the complexity of the environment to make it as close to reality as possible. FIFA, the world football governing body, is launching an annual Peace Prize, which will be awarded for the first time next month in Washington, DC. President Gianni Infantino explained that the prize will honor exceptional actions promoting peace, although he did not reveal the recipient. The award is part of FIFA's Football for the World campaign, which emphasizes the role of football in bringing people together and giving hope. Infantino has a close relationship with US President Donald Trump, who recently failed to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Some observers speculate that Trump could receive FIFA's new award, though the organization insists it cannot solve geopolitical problems. FIFA also maintains that sports and politics should remain separate, even if its actions suggest otherwise. The prize will be announced during the World Cup draw on December 5th in Washington, adding global attention to both football and peace initiatives, despite public amusement and mixed reactions from fans and commentators. Communities in Asia, Africa, and South America consider meal worms and crickets to be superfoods, and insects are a common part of their diet. Scientists discovered that mealworms can taste like meat when they are cooked with sugar. Depending on how you cook them, their flavor changes. A steamed mealworm gives off a sweetcorn-like aroma; however, if you roast or deep fry it, it tastes like shrimp. Experts say that insects are a great source of protein and other nutrients, and they are much better for the planet than the traditional meat diet. Insects use up less land and water, and they produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions. A US judge has dismissed the criminal case against Boeing over two deadly crashes of its 737 Max 8 planes that killed 346 people. The decision came after a request from the Department of Justice (DOJ), which had earlier reached a 2021 deal with Boeing to avoid prosecution if the company improved safety and transparency. However, in 2024, the DOJ said Boeing violated that agreement. The judge harshly criticized the government's move, saying it failed to bring accountability and ensure the safety of passengers. Both crashes were caused by a flawed flight control system design. Families of the victims and experts worry that Boeing will not face enough independent supervision, as the company will now choose its own safety consultant instead of an outside monitor. Critics fear this decision could risk public confidence in air travel safety. Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, was crowned the new Miss Universe in Bangkok, Thailand, marking the end of an exceptionally scandal-filled pageant season. The 25-year-old winner's victory was overshadowed by controversy that involved allegations of mistreatment and competition rigging. Earlier in November, Bosch herself, along with other contestants, walked out of an event after an official publicly berated her and threatened to disqualify those who offered support. Following this incident, two judges resigned, with one accusing the organizers of rigging the competition. The Miss Universe Organization later denied any wrongdoing. The pageant also featured Miss Palestine for the first time, adding to the high-profile nature of the event. Despite the turbulence and the financial uncertainty surrounding the Miss Universe Organization, the contest concluded, with Bosch continuing to compete and ultimately winning the title. Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to become Speaker of the US House of Representatives, has announced she will retire from Congress after more than 35 years of service. In her farewell video, Pelosi reflected on her long political career and her deep connection to her home city, San Francisco. She celebrated the city's creativity, resilience, and diversity, calling it the most beautiful place on Earth. During her 20 terms in Congress, Pelosi helped pass major laws, including the Affordable Care Act and measures to support clean energy and job creation. She thanked San Franciscans for trusting her and said representing them was her greatest honor. Pelosi urged citizens to continue defending democracy and to keep San Francisco a beacon of hope and progress for future generations. Czech visionary Josef Průša has redefined additive manufacturing through his pioneering 3D printing technology. Originally a student fascinated by music equipment, he engineered his own self-replicating 3D printer, an innovation that soon became an industry standard. In 2012, he left university to establish Prusa Research, which has since evolved into a global enterprise based in Prague. The firm employs more than 1,200 people, exports worldwide, and generates annual revenues exceeding 160 million euros. Its award-winning machines are used by leading institutions such as NASA, CERN, and MIT, as well as numerous startups. Průša's philosophy centers on decentralizing production and stimulating European innovation. By making high-quality 3D printing accessible, he envisions a future where creativity, technology, and sustainability merge to reshape manufacturing across the continent. The Grand Egyptian Museum has officially opened near the pyramids of Giza after 20 years of construction. It cost around one billion dollars, financed mostly through Japanese loans. The new museum, one of the world's largest dedicated to a single civilization, houses tens of thousands of artifacts, including all the treasures of the ancient Pharaoh Tutankhamun, shown together for the first time. Presidents, prime ministers, and royalty attended the grand opening, which featured fireworks and drone shows lighting the night sky over Cairo. The Egyptian government hopes the museum will boost tourism and help the country's struggling economy. Despite challenges such as the Arab Spring, the pandemic, and regional conflicts, Egypt finally celebrates a new chapter in its long history, aiming to attract millions of visitors in the coming years. Built close to the Great Pyramids, the museum symbolizes national pride and cultural heritage. Shein, the Chinese online shopping giant, has banned all sex dolls and stopped selling adult products after a major scandal in France. The issue began when French authorities discovered that the site was offering dolls with childlike appearances, which caused public outrage. France's finance minister, Roland Lescure, warned that Shein could be banned from operating in France if it ever sold such products again. In response, Shein said it had punished the merchants involved and improved its system by adding more banned keywords to prevent similar violations. France's child protection commissioner, Sarah El Haïry, stated that buying such dolls is unacceptable and can be linked to criminal behavior. Meanwhile, Shein is planning to open a new store in Paris, but small protests have already taken place outside the location. The company said it condemns these acts and is conducting an internal investigation. English actor Jonathan Bailey, known for his roles in Bridgerton and the upcoming film Wicked: For Good, has been named People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive for 2025. Bailey, 37, said it was a huge honor to receive the title, which has previously gone to stars like Chris Hemsworth and George Clooney. He is also believed to be the first openly gay man to receive the recognition. People magazine explained that the award is not based only on looks but also on personality, talent, and influence. Bailey appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to celebrate and posed with his dog Benson for the magazine's cover. The humorous article also mentioned that last year's winner, John Krasinski, has now lost the title, and that the magazine does not pay or charge the winner. The Sexiest Man Alive is mostly a fun cultural tradition celebrating charm and popularity. Kylian Mbappé, the French forward for Real Madrid, received the 2024–25 Golden Boot award at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Golden Boot recognizes the season's top scorer across European leagues. Mbappé scored 31 goals last season, earning the prestigious individual trophy for the first time. Mbappé said this award is an important moment for him and thanked all his teammates, emphasizing that their support helps him perform at his best and contribute to the team's success. He expressed confidence in Real Madrid's collective strength, believing that with this group, they can win many awards this year. Mbappé has also started the current season exceptionally well, scoring 16 goals in 13 matches, showing his consistency and elite performance. He highlighted that collective awards are the most important, stressing the value of teamwork alongside individual recognition. His statement underlines both personal achievement and team cooperation, demonstrating his commitment to success and passion for football. Across the world, a summer of drought revealed long-submerged relics. The Dinosaur Valley State Park in Texas, US, has discovered dinosaur footprints; they were preserved for millions of years under layers of sediment, clay, and limestone. The drought shrunk the Paluxy River, which revealed the tracks from millions of years ago, and then, rains submerged them once again. The park claimed that the footprints were over 113 million years old, so they may be the longest tracks made by a single dinosaur in North America. Park officials said that many footprints appeared and disappeared throughout the park, depending on the weather. These particular footprints were last visible 20 years ago. Vinicius Jr, the Real Madrid forward, has issued a public apology for his outburst during El Clásico but did not mention coach Xabi Alonso. The incident occurred after Vinicius got substituted in the 72nd minute of the match, which Real Madrid won 2-1 against Barcelona. He shouted to the manager that he wanted to leave the team, showing frustration and strong emotion. In his statement, he apologized to the fans, teammates, the club, and the president, emphasizing that his reaction reflected his passion and competitive nature. Vinicius explained that sometimes his passion gets the better of him, and he always wants to win and support his team. He described his love for Real Madrid and his commitment to fighting for the club in every match. Although he expressed regret for his behavior, he maintained that his competitive attitude comes from dedication and loyalty to the team, rather than personal resentment toward anyone. This incident highlights the pressures elite athletes face during high-profile matches. The body's appendix is the small tube that is attached to our large intestine, and it is located in the lower right side of our belly. Scientists agree that the appendix might be a leftover organ as humans evolved, and it gets little credit because people can generally live without it. However, a study published in 2007 suggests that the appendix could help with digestion. Researchers found that the appendix helps store good microbes that digest food. These good bacteria leave our body when we are ill, and the appendix releases more of them. Another study suggests that the appendix strengthens our immunity. It contains lymphoid cells that help the body fight infection. People without their appendix are more likely to have a severe illness if they get an infection from bacteria that because diarrhea and colon inflammation. Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau celebrated the singer's 41st birthday in Paris by going to a cabaret show at the famous Crazy Horse. This marked their first public appearance as a couple. Weeks before, Katy hinted at her new romance during her London concert, where a fan even proposed marriage to her. Katy and Justin first sparked rumors about dating in July, shortly after Katy ended her engagement with actor Orlando Bloom. Trudeau, the former Canadian prime minister, had separated from his wife in 2023. Later, the couple was seen having dinner together in Montreal. Just a day before they were photographed kissing on a yacht in Santa Barbara, Katy joked about the fan proposal at her concert. In Paris, they held hands and accepted flowers from fans, making their relationship public. The media followed the story closely, and fans were excited to see them happy together. This birthday outing confirmed their romance and showed the world that Katy and Justin are now officially a couple, enjoying time together while keeping busy with work and tours. Illegal gold mining in the Amazon is causing a serious health crisis. Miners use mercury to extract gold, but the chemical contaminates rivers and the food chain. Fish accumulate mercury, which Indigenous communities consume daily. Pregnant women absorb mercury, which can pass to their babies via the placenta or breast milk, leading to severe neurological disorders. Children in some villages cannot lift their heads, experience muscle spasms, or have delayed development. Brazilian scientists are conducting a multi-year study of 176 mothers and their infants. Preliminary findings show that mercury levels in mothers are five times above safe limits, and in babies, three times above. Establishing a direct causal link is difficult because other factors, like genetics or infections, could contribute to disorders. Mercury is persistent in the environment, remaining for decades even if mining stops. The communities face a moral and survival dilemma: obey health warnings or continue eating contaminated fish to avoid starvation. Researchers hope the study will influence policies to protect Indigenous people and reduce environmental contamination. King Charles has removed Prince Andrew's royal titles, including "Prince" and "Duke of York," and ordered him to leave his luxurious home, the Royal Lodge. This marks a final step in distancing the monarchy from Andrew's long-running scandals involving Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Andrew was accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexual abuse when she was 17, though he denied the allegations and settled her lawsuit in 2022 without admitting guilt. Public anger reignited after Giuffre's memoir described her experiences. Many people see the king's decision as a way to protect the monarchy's image. Andrew now lives a private life without public duties and faces strong public disapproval. Critics, however, argue that losing his titles is not enough and demand a full legal investigation. Despite this scandal, most Britons still support the monarchy, though they believe changes are needed for greater accountability. Amazon opened its largest AI data center on 1,200 acres in Indiana, hosting half a million AWS Tranium 2 chips to support Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor. Just over a year ago, the area was farmland, but now seven buildings are operational, with plans for around 30 total. The center will use 2.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough for over a million homes. Locals express concern about the impact on utilities, water, and roads, and Amazon is funding upgrades and improvements. This rapid buildout is unusual, but Amazon emphasizes its expertise in large-scale AI infrastructure. The company designs and uses its own Tranium chips rather than Nvidia GPUs, allowing cost efficiency and high compute capacity. Anthropic benefits from this partnership as Amazon provides scalable AI training infrastructure. Despite criticism about overbuilding and potential inefficiencies, the project demonstrates how major tech firms can quickly deploy custom AI hardware at an industrial scale. The site is part of a broader multi-campus AI expansion in the United States. Bubble tea, also known as boba, has become a global phenomenon, loved for its colorful look and sweet taste. Originating in Taiwan in the 1980s, it mixes tea, milk, sugar, and tapioca pearls. Social media helped turn it into a popular trend, but now experts are warning about health risks. Tests in the United States found small amounts of lead in tapioca pearls, made from cassava that absorbs heavy metals from soil. Although the levels are low, repeated exposure may be harmful. Doctors also warn that drinking bubble tea too often can because digestive problems, kidney stones, and obesity due to its high sugar content, sometimes up to 50 grams per cup. Some pearls can even because choking, especially in children. Experts suggest smaller cups, less sugar, and water instead of sweet drinks. Bubble tea is safe in moderation, but unhealthy as a daily habit. A police raid in Rio de Janeiro targeting the Red Command drug gang left at least 64 people dead, including four police officers. The large-scale operation took place in the poor areas of Complexo do Alemão and Penha, involving helicopters, armored vehicles, and hundreds of officers. Authorities said 81 suspects were arrested and large amounts of drugs and weapons were seized. Rio's governor described the operation as the biggest in the city's history. However, human rights organizations and the UN condemned the violence, calling for investigations into possible abuses. Critics said such raids are often inefficient, as they target low-level members rather than gang leaders. The clashes caused chaos in Rio, with buses burned and schools closed. Experts described the death toll as war numbers, showing how violent Brazil's drug conflict has become. A wedding video from Iran has caused a major political controversy. The footage shows the daughter and wife of Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, a senior Iranian official, wearing Western-style clothes without hijabs. This sparked anger because ordinary Iranian women face harsh punishments for similar behavior under strict Islamic laws. Shamkhani, who once led Iran's National Security Council during the protests over Mahsa Amini's death, is accused of hypocrisy, demanding modesty from citizens while his own family ignores these rules. The case highlights a deep double standard within Iran's ruling class, where powerful figures live freely while others suffer. Many Iranians criticized Shamkhani online, but he dismissed the backlash and blamed Israel for leaking the video. The story reflects a broader pattern seen in many countries, where politicians control women's choices in public but allow different rules for themselves and their families. Flippy 2 is an AI robotic fry station developed by automation company Miso Robotics in California, US. The robot completes all the tasks of cooking fried food for fast food restaurants, so it removes much of the human work. The machine also can cook different meals simultaneously, which removes the need for catering staff, and it hurries the drive-through process. Flippy 2's robotic arm is similar to a machine in car plants, and cameras and AI power its manufacturing. When an order comes, the robot automatically receives instructions, it takes a frozen product, fries it for the precise amount of time, and puts the finished product in a box. According to Miso's CEO, the robot works faster, more accurately, more reliably, and happier than most humans. Positions at frying stations are the hardest to fill and retain, so the robot does not take workers' jobs. People are delighted to have the help, so they can do other tasks. Dahbia Benkired, a 27-year-old woman from Algeria, received a life sentence without parole for raping, torturing, and killing 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris in 2022. It is the first time in French history that such a sentence has been given to a woman. During the trial, Benkired showed no emotion, even when shown photos of her victim. Experts said she had no mental illness but described her as cold and lacking empathy. She said she was indifferent when asked about the murder. The crime shocked France and started a political debate because Benkired was in the country illegally. The court heard about her difficult past, including childhood violence, abuse, and drug use, but the jury still found her fully responsible. French law allows a review of such sentences after 30 years, but only under very strict conditions. Lola's family expressed deep sadness during the verdict and said they wanted justice for their daughter. Why do we say "God bless you" when someone sneezes? People cannot say exactly when or where the response started; however, we have some theories. A long time ago, people thought that when someone sneezed, snot and the soul escaped, too, and to say "God bless you" was to help. Another theory is from the 6th century when a plague struck Europe, and Pope Gregory I formally ordered people shout out blessings to protect someone who sneezed. Similarly, in the 14th century during the bubonic plague, sneezing was a sign that a person might be sick with the plague. Today, the reaction is mostly ingrained, and people think it is polite. However, people do not use it worldwide. For example, in Spanish speaking countries, people say "salud", which can be translated to "good health".
