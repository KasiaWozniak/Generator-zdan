Football star Cristiano Ronaldo was at the White House for a special dinner as US President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This meeting helped end the Prince's diplomatic break after the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr, a team that Prince Mohammed's group mostly owns. Ronaldo sat near important business leaders like Elon Musk and the boss of Apple. Trump said his son, Barron, was a big fan of Ronaldo. Ronaldo also helped Saudi Arabia get the right to host the 2034 World Cup. During the visit, Trump did not allow reporters to ask about human rights. Trump also announced that Saudi Arabia will invest huge amounts of money in the US. The Prince visits Washington because his country wants to change and grow its economy and make it strong. Students at the University of Staffordshire say they feel cheated because a digital course uses AI for much of its teaching. One student, James, spoke to his teacher in a meeting, saying that AI made the class slides for the coding module. He said the teacher did not even check the notes well. The student said he does not want AI to teach him and that the use of the slides insults the students' intelligence because they can easily tell the content is AI-made. He feels the university robs the students of a good education. The university has a new policy that seems to justify using AI in teaching. This policy gives rules for how teachers can use AI tools to help with their work. Russian President Vladimir Putin changed Russia's nuclear rules. He said that he would use nuclear strikes even as a reaction to non-nuclear attacks. Before, Russia only used nuclear weapons if its survival was at risk. Now, it could use them if its sovereignty is in danger. This happened on the same day Ukraine used US rockets to strike deep into Russian territory. Ukraine's President Zelensky said that Putin spoke about nuclear weapons instead of peace. Experts warn that this could lead to a nuclear conflict. But the US does not change its nuclear plans. Russia's soldiers are moving quickly. Western leaders criticized Putin's words and they promised to continue support for Ukraine. Poland is now the 20th biggest economy in the world, and it grows quickly. Low unemployment and a clear tax system make the country attractive for people who start businesses, especially Ukrainians. Poland has successfully moved from a communist to a market-based society in one generation. Ukrainian people help Poland's economy grow a lot, and they now make up about 2.7% of its wealth. It is easy for Ukrainian founders to open a company in Poland, and the government process is simple and electronic. Finding money to start a business can be difficult. Ukrainian businesspeople move their companies to Poland to continue their work. They feel the mentality and language are close to their own. These businesses expand in many areas, from technology to restaurants, and their role is very important for Poland's continuing economic growth. A civil war in Sudan has lasted for over two years and has stopped millions of students from getting an education. Many schools are in war areas or people use them as shelters, and many students miss their exams. This problem is very bad in places like Khartoum. Sudan is one of the biggest and poorest countries in Africa. The war started when two army leaders turned against each other, and the fighting has killed over 150,000 people. Around 12 million people have left their homes, and the UN calls it the world's biggest crisis. Some students try to study online, but they have problems with bad internet and the cost of data. Students also feel very sad and lonely because of the war and the trauma. Some schools are opening again in safer parts of Sudan, and universities are trying to bring students back. A UN project also helps students in refugee camps continue to study online. Eighty years ago, the Nuremberg Trials started right after World War II to judge Nazi leaders for their crimes. One important leader was Hermann Göring. During the trial, 120 people spoke, showing how bad the Nazi actions were. The court found 12 people guilty and sentenced them to death, seven went to prison, and three people did not receive a punishment. The Nuremberg Trial was very important because it said that people, not just countries, must be responsible for their bad actions during a war. This trial helped to create the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC later held trials for people like Radovan Karadžić, who were responsible for bad actions in the former Yugoslavia. Now, the ICC has ordered the arrest of Hamas leaders and Israeli officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu, for things they did near Gaza. However, some countries, like the US, put pressure on the ICC, which makes things slower. The main message from Nuremberg is that people who commit genocide must always go to court. The Enigma Machine was a cipher machine for Nazi Germany. During World War II, they used it to encrypt messages. Alan Turing was a British cryptanalyst who worked with a team to solve the machine's codes. After this happened, German Fritz Menzer developed another cipher machine called SG-41. This machine used more complicated rules, so the codes were more difficult to solve. In 2017, a treasure hunter found SG-41 in a forest. Someone maybe hid the machine underground, so people could find it when the war ended. Now, SG-41 is in a museum in Munich, Germany, and thanks to modern technologies, visitors can look inside it. Northern Japan sees more bear attacks, so police now cull bears to protect people. To learn better ideas, Japanese experts traveled to Montana in the US, where many specialist workers manage wild animals. At a big workshop, experts from many countries talked about how people and bears meet more often and what problems this creates. In Japan, older civilian hunters do most of the work, and the number of hunters becomes smaller. In the US, trained workers respond quickly when people report bears. They also prevent problems by using electric fences, cleaning garbage, and teaching local communities how to stay safe. Japanese experts say they need more trained workers and more jobs in this field to improve safety. In 2017, the app Play: Date started.

There is also a gingerbread Broadway stage that shows characters from famous musicals. People can visit the event until January 19 and vote for their favorite creation. Scientists see strong aurora borealis in many US states and explain that the lights come from solar storms. These storms start when the sun sends out hot material and magnetic energy. The storms move through space, reach Earth, and shake our magnetic field. This energy creates the northern and southern lights. The storms also because trouble for power networks because they create electric currents. Satellites in low orbit face more drag, so controllers use extra fuel to keep them at the right height. Rockets and GPS also face problems. Very accurate GPS becomes less correct during strong storms. Because of this, experts talk all day with people who run important systems and try to keep everything safe. The UK government plans to build new small modular reactors on the island of Anglesey. The work will start next year at the old Wylfa nuclear site, and the goal is to make energy by the mid-2030s. These reactors cost less, and building them is faster than normal nuclear plants. They can give power to about three million homes. The project can bring up to 3,000 jobs and help families stay in the area. Local leaders support the plan. They say the island needs new jobs because many young people leave to find work. Some people still worry; they question the safety and the future of the project. They want a clear plan that shows how the reactors can help the island in the long term. Levi's will sell 300-dollar Blue Tab jeans in more stores next year because many people want expensive denim.

Rats are very curious and they like to explore, so people train them just like dogs. They are very small, so they can easily move through debris. Also, they have very good smell to find things. The animals wear a small backpack with special technology. A video camera and a device helps rescuers communicate with survivors. Currently people train the rats in a simulated disaster zone. When the rat finds the person in an empty room, it pulls a switch on their vest. This sends a signal to rescuers that someone is in the debris. Then, the rat returns to the rescuers, and they reward the animal. FIFA will give a new Peace Prize every year. Somebody will get the first prize in Washington, DC, next month. FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, said the award will honor people who do special things to support peace. He did not say who would get the prize. This award is part of FIFA's plan to show that football can bring people together and give hope.

The prize will be announced during the World Cup draw on December 5th. Many fans are amused, but some like the idea of connecting football with peace. In many parts of the world, people eat insects. They are a normal part of people's diet because they are everywhere, and they are healthy to eat. In the Western World, many people think that eating insects is disgusting. Scientists said that meal worms tasted like meat, and they tasted differently if you cooked them differently. If you steam them, they smell like sweetcorn. If you roast or fry them, they taste like shrimp. Insects as food have more benefits. They are healthy and better for the planet than meat. They need less land and water, and they do not make any gases like cows and other big animals. A US judge stopped a criminal case against Boeing after two plane crashes killed 346 people.

The mercury gets into fish, which local people eat every day. Pregnant women can pass mercury to their babies through the placenta or breast milk. Some children have serious health problems, like weak muscles or trouble moving. Scientists from Brazil's health institute are studying 176 mothers and their babies. They found mercury levels five times higher than safe limits in mothers and three times higher in babies. Researchers are trying to prove that mercury from gold mining causes these problems. Even if mining stops, mercury will stay in the rivers and the ground for tens of years. Families have a difficult choice: follow health rules and be hungry, or eat fish with mercury. The situation shows how gold mining can damage the natural world and people's health.

In the past, when someone sneezed, people thought that his soul left the body. All they could saw was "God bless you." In the 6th century, a plague happened in Europe, and Pope Gregory I ordered people to give blessings to someone who sneezed. In the 14th century, another plague happened, and a person who sneezed could be sick. People started to say, "God bless you." These days, for many people, the response is a natural reaction, and many think that it is polite to say it. In some countries, people do not say it. For example, in Spanish language countries, people say the word "salud." It means something like "good health".
